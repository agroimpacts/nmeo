The purpose of this course is to introduce students to recent advances
in Earth Observation technology that are leading to breakthroughs in our
ability to make sense of whatâ€™s happening on our planet. Drawing on
material from ongoing research projects, the course focuses primarily on
the following areas:

1.  Cloud-computing/cloud-based EO platforms
2.  Small satellites
3.  UAS/drones
4.  In situ sensor networks
5.  Advanced ML/Deep learning

Course learning is drawn from some background reading, brief lectures,
participation and completion of in-class practicals, and a final group
project.
